1
00:00:10,564 --> 00:00:12,144
-(woman) Rolling, right?
-(man) Yes.

2
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:13,935
(woman) Doctor...

3
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:15,635
Doctor?

4
00:00:15,835 --> 00:00:17,508
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

5
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:19,073
Ready.

6
00:00:19,098 --> 00:00:21,960
(woman) Sir, how did Zaathi start?

7
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:24,344
Yes...

8
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:26,856
It was in Delhi.

9
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:28,334
We were a group of eight.

10
00:00:28,745 --> 00:00:30,592
We were partying after this...

11
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:33,785
boring medical conference.

12
00:00:35,817 --> 00:00:39,370
In the middle of it,
Dr. Gulati got a call.

13
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,082
One of his patients...

14
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,424
he was dying due to sepsis.

15
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:48,987
He didn't have enough money

16
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,998
to buy the emergency medicine
prescribed to him.

17
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:56,534
(sighs)

18
00:00:56,568 --> 00:00:57,735
Lakhs.

19
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:00,199
It cost him lakhs

20
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:02,725
just for one injection only.

21
00:01:03,977 --> 00:01:06,304
The same molecule is available
with another brand as well.

22
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,343
And that costs only ₹17,000.

23
00:01:10,106 --> 00:01:11,279
Just some

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,917
generic medicine.

25
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:18,302
But that one
was not available anywhere.

26
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:22,095
Mysteriously out of stock.

27
00:01:22,645 --> 00:01:23,792
Everywhere.

28
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:26,904
That night, that same night

29
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:28,470
that patient...

30
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,243
he passed away.

31
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:33,859
(mysterious score)

32
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:40,063
That night, on that table,

33
00:01:40,743 --> 00:01:43,196
Zaathi was born.

34
00:01:44,025 --> 00:01:47,272
As a supply chain for generic drugs.

35
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:50,511
A very humble beginning.

36
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:54,832
But we never imagined

37
00:01:55,497 --> 00:01:57,910
it would lead to such a huge battle.

38
00:01:58,974 --> 00:02:00,314
We never...

39
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:02,875
Mmm-mmm.

40
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:07,776
(engine rumbling)

41
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:17,303
-(gunshots)
-(shell casings clink)

42
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:26,638
(opening theme music)

43
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,246
(bell tolls)

44
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,464
(conch blowing)

45
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:08,997
-(train chugs)
-(faint station announcements)

46
00:03:10,544 --> 00:03:12,775
(mysterious score)

47
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:15,429
Hello, sir?
I came out through the front exit.

48
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,088
Near the bike parking.

49
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,922
(man) Yeah, there. Walk straight.

50
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:22,105
Okay, sir.

51
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:24,252
Hello, sir. I'm K.P. Vinod.

52
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:26,585
Have you had lunch?

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,680
Lunch... No, sir.

54
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:31,006
Do you eat biryani?

55
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:33,026
Yeah. Sure, sir.

56
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,341
All right, come on.

57
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,991
It's a one-crore market.
Isn't it, sir?

58
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,085
I'm basically from Wayanad, sir.

59
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:51,427
I did my Bachelor of Pharmacy
in Kozhikode.

60
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:54,049
I was the Mysore University topper
for the Master of Pharmacy.

61
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,692
For a while,
I worked at a medical shop, too.

62
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,837
I joined RXLH after that.

63
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,724
So?

64
00:04:03,936 --> 00:04:05,490
I am very much excited, sir.

65
00:04:06,638 --> 00:04:08,184
Such a huge market

66
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,837
and working in a team
under a senior manager like you.

67
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:11,871
(chuckles)

68
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,857
What's the speciality here, sir?

69
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,650
This is the only place in Thrissur

70
00:04:21,205 --> 00:04:23,193
that serves
boiled eggs with biryani.

71
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,615
That's the speciality.
Okay? Eat now.

72
00:04:25,987 --> 00:04:28,338
(whimsical score plays)

73
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:32,029
My mom lives alone in our hometown.

74
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,779
She won't come here
even if I ask her to.

75
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,766
I worked at the same medical shop
as my mom.

76
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,452
So, I thoroughly know
about medicines.

77
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:39,872
I'm gonna rock this!

78
00:04:40,409 --> 00:04:44,596
(quirky, whimsical music)

79
00:04:55,774 --> 00:04:57,548
(engine idling)

80
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:02,745
(car door closes)

81
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:06,245
(car door shuts)

82
00:05:09,297 --> 00:05:10,617
Stay here for the time being.

83
00:05:10,897 --> 00:05:13,124
-A company bike is also here.
-Okay.

84
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,640
You can find a house later and move.

85
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:18,826
But on one condition.

86
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,880
-You must stay here alone.
-Okay.

87
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:23,434
Our company doesn't like
you "having company."

88
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:25,689
You had a long journey, right?

89
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:28,647
Go to your room, freshen up,
and get a good rest.

90
00:05:28,672 --> 00:05:29,687
Okay. Thank you, sir.

91
00:05:29,712 --> 00:05:31,507
And get ready in half an hour.

92
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,024
-What?
-(whimsical score)

93
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:35,625
What, you ask?
Shouldn't we start work?

94
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,594
-Why else would I come from Kochi?
-(mumbles) Okay, sir.

95
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:40,499
I gotta go back after inducting you.

96
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:43,112
Okay, sir. I'll be right back.

97
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:47,240
We've an urgent meeting at
the hospital. You've got 29 minutes.

98
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:48,272
Okay, sir.

99
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:53,807
(puzzling score)

100
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,508
Your keys.

101
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,882
All right.

102
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,517
(music turns jaunty)

103
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,146
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

104
00:06:08,552 --> 00:06:09,939
Streptococcus pneumoniae.

105
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:11,891
Staphylococcus aureus.

106
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,717
Sa...

107
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,391
Sa...?

108
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,112
Ugh!

109
00:06:19,398 --> 00:06:20,811
I always forget this one!

110
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,034
Salmonella enterica.

111
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,540
Salmonella... enterica.

112
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:34,821
(jaunty score continues)

113
00:06:41,065 --> 00:06:43,012
(in mild voice) Good morning, Doctor.
I am K.P. Vinod.

114
00:06:44,393 --> 00:06:46,320
(in deep voice) Good morning, Doctor.
I am K.P. Vinod.

115
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,194
(in raised voice) Good morning, doctor.
I am K.P. Vinod.

116
00:06:51,247 --> 00:06:52,253
Okay.

117
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:56,497
(latch clicks open)

118
00:07:01,857 --> 00:07:04,185
(jaunty score)

119
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:13,716
(Alex) Hey.

120
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:16,516
This is the top hospital
on our list.

121
00:07:16,576 --> 00:07:17,890
Marwellous.

122
00:07:18,435 --> 00:07:19,742
Wow.

123
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:21,422
Such an auspicious hospital.

124
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,101
The best place to start my work.

125
00:07:24,408 --> 00:07:25,877
(car lock beeps)

126
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:29,346
Are you gonna stand there?

127
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:34,039
(slow, uplifting score)

128
00:07:39,549 --> 00:07:41,916
-(stretcher wheels squeaking)
-(indistinct chatter around)

129
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:44,542
(Alex) You'll have to
come here twice a week, at least.

130
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:46,167
Okay? Huh?

131
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:49,800
What are you doing, man?

132
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:51,253
It's my first day, sir.

133
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:53,588
-Not breaking a coconut for luck?
-Mom will do it at home.

134
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:56,153
That's great! Are you coming now?

135
00:07:58,026 --> 00:08:00,206
(lively score)

136
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:10,175
-What's this, man?
-Coming, sir.

137
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,555
(light, upbeat music)

138
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,854
(music intensifies)

139
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,332
Keep your bag there.

140
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:38,881
(man) RXLH's new recruit is here.

141
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,665
Will I take any other bag
by mistake?

142
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,810
-(man) Are you new?
-Huh? Yes.

143
00:08:53,137 --> 00:08:55,190
-I'm Davis.
-I'm Vinod. K.P. Vinod.

144
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,558
Vinod!

145
00:08:57,186 --> 00:08:58,660
Go ahead.

146
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,024
-Leave the detailing book.
-No, sir. I've got it by heart!

147
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:10,107
(indistinct chatter)

148
00:09:11,055 --> 00:09:12,702
The doctor won't see
anyone else today.

149
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:14,562
He just got a call.
His mother passed away.

150
00:09:14,688 --> 00:09:15,908
He's leaving now.

151
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:17,998
(incoherent voices)

152
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:19,424
What an auspicious start!

153
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:21,722
What are you waiting for?
Get your bag.

154
00:09:22,359 --> 00:09:23,393
Go on.

155
00:09:23,615 --> 00:09:25,362
(whimsical music)

156
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,174
Ah, Alex. Come inside.

157
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,280
Come on!

158
00:09:42,413 --> 00:09:43,786
-But she said he won't meet--
-Come!

159
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:46,240
(doctor) Get me their study papers.

160
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:49,477
The trip will be
only after two months, right?

161
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:50,845
Yes, sir.

162
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:53,105
We'll submit the visa documents
this week itself.

163
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,957
That's why I thought of signing them
now itself.

164
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:58,771
I won't be around this week.

165
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,224
Okay, sir.

166
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,294
Sir, he's our new recruit.

167
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:05,320
Vinod. K.P. Vinod.

168
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:09,073
(whimsical music continues)

169
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,080
The cremation is tomorrow.

170
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:13,424
You wanna give it a shot?

171
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,030
Palintos is taking care of it now.

172
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:16,394
How much are they doing it for?

173
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:18,228
Well, they said 350.

174
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:20,661
How much is the estimate, sir?

175
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:22,168
Above five.

176
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,503
Oh, no.
We'll need approval for that.

177
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,249
Forget it then.

178
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:28,802
This is your problem.

179
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:30,075
Approval, it seems!

180
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:32,660
Let me know
once the visa is approved.

181
00:10:32,727 --> 00:10:33,840
Okay, sir.

182
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:37,861
What was that, sir?

183
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:39,474
Oh, that?

184
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:41,100
We have an offer.

185
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,941
If the doctor writes 200 prescriptions
with our medicine,

186
00:10:43,966 --> 00:10:45,600
we offer him a trip to Switzerland.

187
00:10:46,077 --> 00:10:48,451
We don't call it
an "offer," actually.

188
00:10:49,104 --> 00:10:50,644
We call it an "efficacy study."

189
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:54,689
Well, he mentioned
Palintos and some 350...

190
00:10:54,714 --> 00:10:56,149
What was that?

191
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,239
Oh, that one?

192
00:10:58,285 --> 00:11:00,206
His mom kicked the bucket, right?

193
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:02,545
It was about
sponsoring her cremation.

194
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,883
That stupid Palintos team snatched it
for a mere 350 prescriptions.

195
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,037
And we've got
a hell lot of formalities.

196
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:10,708
(sighs)

197
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:12,449
Why don't you do this?

198
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:14,020
That doctor's father is alive.

199
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:15,698
Get his full details.

200
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:17,418
Then get approval.

201
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:21,602
If anything happens to him,
we should file our proposal first.

202
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,285
They snatched his mother.

203
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:25,105
But his father should be all ours!

204
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:35,586
The meeting must've started.

205
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:37,977
What meeting, sir?

206
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:39,490
There are some folks here

207
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,570
who despise us.

208
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:46,253
You know our cancer drug's offer...

209
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:49,144
I mean, study.
They're trying to stop it.

210
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:51,461
You must deal with all this
and learn.

211
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:53,680
Don't wait for me
to arrive from Kochi.

212
00:11:55,151 --> 00:11:56,698
Rajiv Rao.

213
00:11:57,902 --> 00:11:59,468
Isn't he on our list, sir?

214
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,439
-Nope.
-I see.

215
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:04,197
He must practise less, I guess?

216
00:12:04,406 --> 00:12:07,706
There are quite a number of doctors
who practise a lot here.

217
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:10,011
You know this Rajiv Rao...

218
00:12:10,106 --> 00:12:14,386
he's the best in the whole district.

219
00:12:14,792 --> 00:12:16,465
Why isn't he on our list then?

220
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:18,873
What's our list, huh?

221
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,350
The ones who listen to us
are on our list.

222
00:12:22,428 --> 00:12:23,734
Got it?

223
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:26,398
Rao must be here now.

224
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:29,413
He's a major troublemaker here.
Come!

225
00:12:31,415 --> 00:12:32,815
And then there's Dr. Shakeer.

226
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:35,109
He was short of one prescription

227
00:12:35,217 --> 00:12:37,437
to qualify for our Swiss trip.

228
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:41,076
It's beneficial only if our cancer drug
is prescribed in Stage 2.

229
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:43,086
(mysterious score)

230
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:44,586
You know what I did?

231
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,531
I asked the doctor to prescribe
the drug for Stage 4 patients.

232
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:50,825
The patient is gonna die anyway.
What difference does it make then?

233
00:12:51,878 --> 00:12:53,385
-And then?
-Then what?

234
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:55,558
People tried to make it an issue.

235
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,838
Nonsense!

236
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,083
(man 1) Let Dr. Shakeer speak.

237
00:12:58,143 --> 00:12:59,716
(man 2) Look at my prescription!

238
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,956
Sensite infusion thrice a week.

239
00:13:01,997 --> 00:13:03,457
Coupled with other procedures,

240
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:05,490
it is a speciality drug.

241
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:08,068
When I, the oncologist, am here,

242
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:10,034
what is a mere physician doing here?

243
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,097
I really don't understand
the purpose of this meeting.

244
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:14,734
Simply wasting my time!

245
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:16,061
Relax. Relax.

246
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:17,874
Dr. Rajiv.

247
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:20,377
Dr. Shakeer...

248
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,121
The RXLH drug you prescribed,

249
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:26,667
this Sensite... it costs ₹2.5 lakh.

250
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:27,873
(Shakeer) Yeah, so?

251
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:30,606
I have the hospital price list.

252
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,710
Same drug, same molecule,

253
00:13:33,837 --> 00:13:36,030
it is available at Zaathi
for just ₹7,000.

254
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,010
(Shakeer scoffs) Ridiculous!

255
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:40,540
This is a poor man. An auto driver.

256
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,550
Yet you're giving him this?

257
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:45,204
This Sensite?

258
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,365
And that, too, at this stage?

259
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,753
The molecule is what cures
the disease, not the brand.

260
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:52,158
(Shakeer scoffs) Bullshit!

261
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,272
Not the brand, it seems!

262
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:55,492
Doctor, that's a serious allegation.

263
00:13:55,913 --> 00:13:57,320
Doctor, this is India.

264
00:13:57,853 --> 00:14:01,846
There are thousands of companies
with poor manufacturing quality.

265
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:03,977
Brand is important.

266
00:14:04,202 --> 00:14:06,389
-He's got a point.
-There's a study going on too, yeah?

267
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:08,084
Yes. Efficacy study.

268
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:09,959
Everything is
through the proper channel.

269
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:12,518
We've got the consent
from the patient as well.

270
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:14,202
That's the usual practice.

271
00:14:14,342 --> 00:14:17,569
And this isn't some gift scheme
in the name of a study?

272
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:21,596
Doctor, now you're questioning
my integrity.

273
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:24,342
Hey, come on, Rajiv. Stop it.
Come back to the matter.

274
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:26,256
Does it not say in the study

275
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:31,631
that the patient has the right to
withdraw consent at any given time?

276
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:32,831
Yes.

277
00:14:32,856 --> 00:14:33,911
So then?

278
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:35,762
Rajiv, move on from the study part.

279
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,908
-Sir, may I?
-Yes.

280
00:14:41,676 --> 00:14:44,076
Brother, who is the patient to you?

281
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,497
My wife, sir.

282
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:49,049
When I buy something for myself,

283
00:14:49,175 --> 00:14:51,262
I always look at the price.

284
00:14:51,486 --> 00:14:54,313
Whether it is a shirt
or a mobile phone,

285
00:14:54,338 --> 00:14:55,906
I go with the cheapest option

286
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:58,018
and also enquire with
at least ten sellers.

287
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,895
I have a daughter. Elina.

288
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:04,001
When she got unwell...

289
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,293
I didn't care about the money.

290
00:15:06,566 --> 00:15:09,073
I took her to the best hospital
in the city.

291
00:15:09,815 --> 00:15:13,122
We can buy a new phone or a shirt
whenever we want.

292
00:15:13,273 --> 00:15:16,053
But is that the same
when it comes to people?

293
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:21,343
Sir...

294
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,321
I'm okay with the medicine
you prescribed.

295
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:26,911
I don't care about the money, sir.

296
00:15:28,175 --> 00:15:29,900
Even if I have to sell
my autorickshaw...

297
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:31,991
or even...

298
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:33,645
sell my house,

299
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:35,425
I will buy this medicine for her.

300
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,707
I told this
at the pharmacy, sir.

301
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,607
I didn't create this issue.

302
00:15:44,371 --> 00:15:45,444
Sir...

303
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:47,655
See?

304
00:15:47,808 --> 00:15:49,521
I think the issue is resolved.

305
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,060
The bystander has no complaints.

306
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:53,406
Neither does the patient,

307
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:55,066
nor the doctor.

308
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,245
Then what's your problem, Dr. Rajiv?

309
00:15:58,431 --> 00:15:59,813
(Shakeer scoffs)

310
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:02,806
I'm leaving, Doctor.
Patients are waiting.

311
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:06,085
His bloody Zaathi
and medicine sales!

312
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:07,538
I am also leaving.

313
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:10,610
Whether you choose Zaathi
or the hospital...

314
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,570
you'll have to face that question
pretty soon, Doctor.

315
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,040
So, better be ready with an answer.

316
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,770
Is there any doubt
what my answer will be?

317
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:24,681
Doctor...

318
00:16:25,845 --> 00:16:27,118
No hard feelings.

319
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:28,805
It's just business.

320
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,290
(scoffs) Exactly.

321
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,774
(door squeaks opens)

322
00:16:35,114 --> 00:16:36,833
-(door closes)
-Hmm!

323
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:41,586
Uh... you...

324
00:16:41,855 --> 00:16:44,183
Doctor...

325
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:47,231
Come.

326
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:53,945
-How old is your daughter?
-What?

327
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:55,626
Your daughter, Elina.

328
00:16:55,651 --> 00:16:56,666
What daughter?

329
00:16:56,743 --> 00:16:58,790
I don't have a daughter.
All I have is a son.

330
00:16:58,815 --> 00:17:00,263
I was just bluffing there.

331
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:04,135
Every week, you must visit
each ward and get a list.

332
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,872
Yes.

333
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:06,896
Of which doctors
are prescribing which medicines.

334
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:08,663
I gotta meet Alexander.

335
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:10,244
He's the purchase in-charge.

336
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:11,183
Okay.

337
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:14,257
We'll go to the nursing station
and the medical shop after that.

338
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:16,258
I'll do it myself, sir.

339
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:18,273
I've got quite a bit of
field training, after all!

340
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:21,211
Really? Do this then.

341
00:17:21,576 --> 00:17:24,846
Visit the gynaec ward and the
medical shop outside the hospital.

342
00:17:24,973 --> 00:17:26,273
Let's meet after that.

343
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,426
-Okay, sir.
-Fine. Go now.

344
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,482
Gynaec ward...

345
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,519
(playful score)

346
00:17:38,201 --> 00:17:39,776
Good afternoon, sisters!

347
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,473
I am K.P. Vinod
from RX Life Healthcare Ltd.

348
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:47,782
How many patients were given
Cetfaclor this week?

349
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:50,338
You may ask the doctor.

350
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:51,924
Why ask them?

351
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:54,662
The gynaec doctors
are close allies of ours.

352
00:17:55,323 --> 00:17:57,297
Really? Which doctor?

353
00:17:58,355 --> 00:17:59,402
All of them.

354
00:17:59,768 --> 00:18:02,556
They all prescribe
only our medicines. What to do!

355
00:18:02,641 --> 00:18:04,521
Yet, I haven't seen you before.

356
00:18:06,008 --> 00:18:07,942
-She is?
-She's the doctor.

357
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:09,368
Dr. Janaki.

358
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:11,927
Oh! Dr. Janaki!

359
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:13,943
(placid music)

360
00:18:20,243 --> 00:18:21,564
You could've told me!

361
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:23,189
-It's no big deal!
-We're in the same field, after all!

362
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:24,580
She's quite friendly.

363
00:18:24,714 --> 00:18:26,134
-Really?
-Yeah.

364
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:29,607
(cheerful score)

365
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:32,171
Please see if our medicines
are delivered on time.

366
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:33,298
Done.

367
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:35,660
Hello!

368
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,907
Doctor... Hi.

369
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:40,400
Hi, I am... Sorry.

370
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:42,435
I am new here. That's why.

371
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:44,425
It's fine. The gynae reps' slot
is on Wednesday.

372
00:18:44,449 --> 00:18:45,783
See you then.

373
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,373
(placid music continues)

374
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,923
(mumbles) That was close.
Didn't ruin it.

375
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:56,620
(lively music)

376
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,685
(music continues)

377
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,808
(indistinct chatter)

378
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:19,769
(man) Okay, got it.

379
00:19:22,513 --> 00:19:23,951
Thank you.

380
00:19:26,638 --> 00:19:31,395
(energetic score)

381
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:40,450
(music fades)

382
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,141
Brother, good afternoon.

383
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,754
Can't you see the rush?

384
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:48,008
Come back later.

385
00:19:49,168 --> 00:19:51,048
(mutters) Him and his lousy bag.

386
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,472
Good afternoon. I'm from RXLH.

387
00:20:01,497 --> 00:20:03,752
So what? Can't you see the rush?

388
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:05,532
Is this the time for this?

389
00:20:05,893 --> 00:20:07,026
Come back later.

390
00:20:08,762 --> 00:20:13,191
(indistinct chatter)

391
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,459
(pharmacist) Yes,
I'll call after some time.

392
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,717
Brother...

393
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:28,617
How many units of Cetfaclor were sold
this week? It's for a survey.

394
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,775
-What is this now--
-The thing is

395
00:20:31,828 --> 00:20:35,188
I'm here to survey this week's
oral antibiotic sales.

396
00:20:35,327 --> 00:20:38,646
-I see! 750 BD, isn't it?
-Yeah.

397
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:43,020
Please wait here, brother.
I'll be back in a jiffy.

398
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:50,690
(woman 1) That's just 50 mg.

399
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,391
(woman 2) Are you a new recruit?

400
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,643
Yeah.

401
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:01,015
The previous guy from your company

402
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,495
kept all this stock here
under "personal intent."

403
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,576
-So?
-You take this away.

404
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:08,927
It's been lying here for a year now,
taking up space.

405
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:10,727
His damned survey!

406
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:13,125
If you don't take this away now,
it'll end up on the road.

407
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:16,508
(quirky score)

408
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:20,022
Hi, sir.

409
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:21,479
(Alex) What's this, huh?

410
00:21:22,095 --> 00:21:24,722
You went for the survey
or to bring these boxes?

411
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,397
So embarrassing!

412
00:21:26,422 --> 00:21:28,550
They gave this to me
when I went there for the survey.

413
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:30,457
The way you went there,
I expected this to happen.

414
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:32,902
-What's this, man?
-What can I do, sir?

415
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:35,361
All right, keep it here.

416
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:38,885
(man chuckles) The new rep
is lugging boxes!

417
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:40,871
(quirky score continues)

418
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:44,477
The sales had gone down
over the last two months

419
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:45,906
since we didn't have a rep.

420
00:21:46,034 --> 00:21:47,041
To the right.

421
00:21:47,066 --> 00:21:48,541
You have to bring them up now.

422
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:49,874
Of course, I will!

423
00:21:49,899 --> 00:21:51,974
Just not like this.

424
00:21:52,328 --> 00:21:53,535
It's for return.

425
00:21:53,668 --> 00:21:54,881
Hello.

426
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:56,375
Keep it there.

427
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,433
-Where's it from?
-The shop near Marwellous Hospital.

428
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:02,648
Aswathy Medicals.

429
00:22:02,673 --> 00:22:05,035
Medical reps should deliver stock,
not return it.

430
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,207
He's our new rep.

431
00:22:06,327 --> 00:22:07,833
Vinod. K.P. Vinod.

432
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:10,963
We have a new product launch.
KydoXin.

433
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,500
You have to support us
regarding the stock, Swamy.

434
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:16,715
You make the prescriptions
reach the medical shops.

435
00:22:16,772 --> 00:22:18,639
-We'll deal with the stock.
-Okay.

436
00:22:18,664 --> 00:22:20,636
If you do enough business,

437
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:21,828
you'll find enough stock here.

438
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:22,998
That's what we want!

439
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:24,779
-All right. See you then.
-Okay.

440
00:22:24,804 --> 00:22:26,444
Did you meet Dr. Sreenivasan?

441
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:27,977
No. We're going there now.

442
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:29,591
Catch hold of him.

443
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:31,397
He'll change the market.

444
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:34,132
All the best. Give it a shot.

445
00:22:35,303 --> 00:22:37,013
(energetic beat plays)

446
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:43,197
This guy, Swamy, can change
our destiny if he wishes.

447
00:22:43,473 --> 00:22:44,901
We shall change our destiny, sir.

448
00:22:45,366 --> 00:22:46,460
You better.

449
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:48,356
I will. Which hospital is next?

450
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:51,815
Sure! Are we on a fun tour
of all the hospitals, little kid?

451
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:53,416
Go and figure it out yourself.

452
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:56,712
Once we meet Dr. Sreenivasan,
my duty will be over.

453
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:01,264
Start meeting the other doctors
on the list on your own.

454
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:04,264
-Okay, sir.
-And send me the reports correctly.

455
00:23:06,195 --> 00:23:08,115
(woman) You guys go next, okay?

456
00:23:08,659 --> 00:23:10,347
(indistinct background chatter)

457
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:11,740
Please don't ruin this.

458
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:15,624
He's the most annoying person
in this town.

459
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:17,026
Nah...

460
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:19,103
Wait and watch
how I impress him! Come.

461
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,454
Huh? Impress him?

462
00:23:20,722 --> 00:23:22,579
-Just come, sir! (clear throat)
-What are you going to do?

463
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:24,313
Good evening, Doctor.

464
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:27,205
Hold on. Stay.

465
00:23:27,445 --> 00:23:29,451
Then, check his vitals.

466
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,137
Yeah.

467
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:33,074
(bouncy score)

468
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,627
Good. Okay.

469
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:39,917
Okay.

470
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,597
Good evening, Doctor.

471
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,938
-Good evening.
-He is our new... rep.

472
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:46,098
Vinod.

473
00:23:46,541 --> 00:23:47,808
K.P. Vinod.

474
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:51,825
Sir, for
your gram-negative infections,

475
00:23:52,037 --> 00:23:53,865
why are you going for
secondary options?

476
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,898
You should not do that.

477
00:23:54,923 --> 00:23:56,004
(mumbles) Stop it, Vinod.

478
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:59,023
Look at this latest issue of
Journal of Internal Medicine.

479
00:23:59,486 --> 00:24:02,833
You should go for a safer,
fourth-generation medicine, sir.

480
00:24:03,851 --> 00:24:06,069
If not,
you are making a mistake, sir.

481
00:24:06,094 --> 00:24:07,043
(mumbles) Dude!

482
00:24:07,068 --> 00:24:08,215
What?

483
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:09,535
What did you say now?

484
00:24:10,675 --> 00:24:14,141
Sir, you should not prescribe
all these old medicines, sir.

485
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,618
What?

486
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:17,202
(mumbles) Stop it, Vinod.

487
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:20,030
Who are you to tell me
"you should not"?

488
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,507
No, Doctor...

489
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:23,440
(shouts) How dare you do that? Huh?

490
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:24,726
Vinod...

491
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:28,540
-Pharmacologically speaking, page 17--
-To hell with your journal! Come on!

492
00:24:29,318 --> 00:24:30,998
I made a mistake, yeah?

493
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:32,711
(tense music)

494
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:34,383
Journal, sir...

495
00:24:34,623 --> 00:24:35,937
Please...

496
00:24:36,211 --> 00:24:37,696
(papers rustling)

497
00:24:37,805 --> 00:24:39,371
Get lost! Idiot!

498
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:43,448
(man) What happened?

499
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,020
We were all waiting here,
but he cut the queue, right?

500
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:48,366
You deserve it!

501
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,059
Yeah, pick them up.

502
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:51,602
(people laughing)

503
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:55,194
(whimsical score)

504
00:24:56,817 --> 00:24:59,515
(Vinod mutters) Shucks! Asshole.

505
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:02,207
(woman) He tried to act smart.
He was thrown out instead.

506
00:25:07,888 --> 00:25:09,215
(Alex) Let it go, man.

507
00:25:09,428 --> 00:25:11,021
Didn't I tell you before?

508
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:12,608
He's a proper pain.

509
00:25:12,988 --> 00:25:16,474
He even pushes away the rep's chairs.
He's such a monster.

510
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,294
In fact, what you said about
his prescriptions is correct.

511
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:25,230
But we need to make him do it
our way, without him realising.

512
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,603
It's okay, sir.

513
00:25:26,922 --> 00:25:28,575
I thought I might need it,

514
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:31,790
so I took an extra copy
from the training team.

515
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:33,268
Huh? What?

516
00:25:33,427 --> 00:25:35,021
The Journal of Internal Medicine.

517
00:25:35,046 --> 00:25:35,847
Wow!

518
00:25:35,872 --> 00:25:37,214
Isn't that our main item, sir?

519
00:25:37,239 --> 00:25:38,740
Yeah, of course!

520
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:40,689
Where is it? Let me see!

521
00:25:40,815 --> 00:25:42,015
Here's it, sir.

522
00:25:42,052 --> 00:25:43,898
Good you took an extra copy.

523
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:45,172
Give it to me.

524
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,667
How's my foresight, sir?

525
00:25:51,914 --> 00:25:53,467
-(paper rips)
-Oh, no!

526
00:25:53,492 --> 00:25:55,172
To hell with your journal!

527
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:56,859
This isn't the main item!

528
00:25:56,985 --> 00:26:00,492
At the end of the month, you'll get
the sales report from the stockist.

529
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,553
That's the main item.
That's the only main item.

530
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:06,172
Got it, you idiot?
Trying to impress people.

531
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:08,964
If the sales go up,
you're the king.

532
00:26:09,224 --> 00:26:10,583
Otherwise, you're a loser.

533
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:11,863
Your job is that simple.

534
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,574
And there he's complicating it!

535
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,068
(playful music)

536
00:26:18,513 --> 00:26:21,553
Forget whatever those idiots
taught you during the training

537
00:26:21,578 --> 00:26:23,140
and get into the market.

538
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:24,713
Got it?

539
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:27,274
When you come
for the next sales meeting,

540
00:26:27,818 --> 00:26:29,738
you must arrive as a king.

541
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,246
Okay?

542
00:26:37,315 --> 00:26:39,046
You know where the lodge is, right?

543
00:26:39,203 --> 00:26:40,435
Carry on, then.

544
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:43,391
Bye.

545
00:26:50,324 --> 00:26:51,717
(man) Buddy,
I had an awesome first day!

546
00:26:51,766 --> 00:26:53,097
Got two prescriptions as well.

547
00:26:53,164 --> 00:26:54,744
And such pretty nurses!

548
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,157
How was it for you?

549
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,270
I'll call you later.

550
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,757
Yeah, call me when you're free.

551
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:03,222
-Hello?
-(woman) Hey, K.P.

552
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,748
Why didn't you answer my call?

553
00:27:04,773 --> 00:27:06,493
I was at my welcome party.

554
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:09,810
You know, my first day was awesome.
Got a few business deals, too.

555
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:11,628
-How was it for you?
-(indistinct chatter)

556
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,502
-K.P.?
-I'll call you later.

557
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:14,969
I'll call you back.

558
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,241
(fire crackles)

559
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:20,851
Doctor... chair for you.

560
00:27:20,876 --> 00:27:21,996
(man 1) Did anyone
try putting it out?

561
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,071
(man 2) The doctor says
we can't go near the fire.

562
00:27:24,284 --> 00:27:25,358
(man 1) Why not?

563
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:27,564
(man 2) He says poisonous gases
might come out of it.

564
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,888
-(man 1) Poisonous gases?
-(man 2) Those are drugs, right?

565
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,640
(man 2) So, he says
we can't go near it.

566
00:27:32,665 --> 00:27:35,553
(man 1) Call the fire force then.
Let them come and put it out.

567
00:27:35,621 --> 00:27:38,136
(fire crackling, whooshing)

568
00:27:39,777 --> 00:27:42,651
(sombre music)

569
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:47,439
(fire crackling)

570
00:27:48,956 --> 00:27:51,425
(siren blares)

571
00:27:57,654 --> 00:28:01,263
(sombre music grows)

572
00:28:06,979 --> 00:28:11,677
(closing theme music)
